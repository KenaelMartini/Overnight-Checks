- **Gold / Brent** : We have stonf comodities with +0.24% on USOIL and +0.30% on Gold. 

## 5. FX daily Bias (Desk View)
- **USD** : Neutral to Slightly Bullish, the dollar is supported by global uncertainty and yen weakness.
- **EUR** : Bearish, political fragility in Europe + weak flows into the euro.
- **GBP** : Neutral, no strong catalyst in sight until BOE commentary.
- **JPY** : Neutral to Bearish, yen collapsing after Takaichi’s rise and markets pricing dovish BOJ.
- **CHF** : Neutral to Slightly Bullish, could act as safe-haven if risk aversion spikes.
- **CAD** : Neutral, dependent on oil; weak upside unless crude surprises.
- **AUD** : Slightly Bullish, benefits from commodity / risk-on tilt.
- **NZD** : Slightly Bullish, similar profile as AUD in this environment.

## 6. Scenarios
- If WTI crude breaks above ~$62.50 with strong momentum → CAD strengthens, pressure on AUD/CAD (bearish for my long exposition)
- If yen continues to crash / BOJ signals more dovishness → flows amplify into commodity / risk currencies (AUD, NZD), supporting your trade.
- if crude reverts / if OPEC+ surprise” + “if safe-haven rush
