# Overnight Check – 2025-10-09

## 1. Asia Session (00h–06h CET)
- **JPY** : Weakness continues. USD/JPY is breaking into 152+ territory, driven by political uncertainty in Japan and dovish expectations from the Bank of Japan.
- **CNH** : Relatively stable. China is re-opening after its Golden Week, which injects some momentum into markets; export restrictions on rare earths are a latent risk. 
- **Asia Equities** : Uptrend, especially in tech and AI-related names. Investors are aggressive entering after U.S. gains.
- **Asia Commodities** : Oil retreating on signs of a ceasefire; metals under mixed pressure from China’s export controls.

## 2. Macro Headlines (Overnight)
- Dollar sets up for strongest week in ~1 year — yen’s collapse is a big part. 
- Asia stocks rally on AI momentum, oil pulls back on Gaza ceasefire hopes.
- BOE warns of sharp correction if sentiment sours on AI or Fed credibility.

- 2:30 PM – 	Fed Chair Powell Speaks / USD – Hight
- 2:30 PM – 	Unemployment Claims / USD – Hight

## 4. Market Sentiment
- **DXY** : Bullish / strong — global political uncertainty is pushing money into the dollar.
- **S&P Futures / VIX** : Risk-on tilt. Futures slightly up, and implied volatility remains moderate — the market is taking on risk.
- **Gold / Brent** : Gold is elevated, hovering near or above record levels — demand for safe havens is strong. Brent is under pressure, sliding with easing geopolitical tensions.

## 5. FX daily Bias (Desk View)

- **NZD** : Bearish, RBNZ cut 50bp, a big surprise, only 25 was exepted.

## 6. Scenarios
